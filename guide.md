Here are the most important points:

### Overnight Accommodations

Unlike what you might be used to at other hackathons, Princeton does not permit 
sleeping overnight in the venue due to fire code restrictions. Instead of 
sleeping at the venue, you have three options:

1.  Arrange to stay with a friend overnight
2.  Arrange to stay at a local hotel. We suggest 
    [Courtyard by Marriott Princeton](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/ttncy-courtyard-princeton/); 
    they’re offering a discount package for HackPrinceton attendees. Email 
    [Tianna.Jenkins@marriott.com](mailto:Tianna.Jenkins@marriott.com) for more 
    information.
3.  Request that we match you with a Princeton student host

For the 3rd option: We can match you with a Princeton student host by request to 
stay with overnight. We’ll send out an email with instructions on how to sign up 
for a host closer to the event. You’ll need to bring your own sleeping bag or 
air mattress, since you’ll likely be sharing floor space with other 
participants.

### Packing List

Things you’ll need:

*   **Student ID:** You’ll need this to check in to the event.

*   **Government-issued ID:** If you want to borrow any hardware from our lab, 
you’ll need to have a government-issued ID (like a driver’s license) in addition 
to your student ID.

*   **Laptop:** Desktops aren’t great travel companions.
*   **Chargers (laptop, phone, etc.):** Make sure to remember chargers for 
    everything you’re bringing.
*   **Headphones:** With so many hackers in one building, it can get a bit loud, 
    so bring headphones if you want to get some quiet time.
*   **Sleeping bag, air mattress, and/or pillow:** If you’re staying with a 
    Princeton student host, you’ll need to bring something to sleep on.
*   **Towel and toiletries:** You’ll definitely want to shower over the weekend.
*   **Layers for 30-60 degree weather:** New Jersey has wild temperature swings, 
    so bring a warm coat and clothes suitable for a wide range of conditions.
*   **Reusable water bottle:** If you have one, bring it and help cut down on 
    waste.

Things you won’t need:

*   **Money for food:** We’ll be providing all the meals and snacks this 
    weekend, so it’s not necessary to bring money specifically for food. (The 
    venue is close to lots of restaurants, though, so do bring some if you want 
    to explore!)
*   **Large suitcase:** There’s limited space for bags, so pack light. A duffel 
    bag is a good idea.

### Miscellaneous

Here’s a few miscellaneous things we’ve received questions about:

*   All meals and snacks are provided, so you don’t have to bring any money for 
    food.
*   Hardware is available to borrow to use in your projects, and the list will 
    be posted on our website closer to the event.
