            <h3>Overnight Accommodations</h3>
            <p>Unlike what you might be used to at other hackathons, Princeton does not permit sleeping overnight in the venue due to fire code restrictions. Instead of sleeping at the venue, you have three options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange to stay with a friend overnight</li>
                <li>Arrange to stay at a local hotel. We suggest <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/ttncy-courtyard-princeton/">Courtyard by Marriott Princeton</a>; they&rsquo;re offering a discount package for HackPrinceton attendees. Email <a href="mailto:Tianna.Jenkins@marriott.com">Tianna.Jenkins@marriott.com</a> for more info</li>
                <li>Request that we match you with a Princeton student host</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For the 3rd option: We can match you with a Princeton student host by request to stay with overnight. We&rsquo;ll send out an email with instructions on how to sign up for a host closer to the event. You&rsquo;ll need to bring your own sleeping bag or air mattress, since you&rsquo;ll likely be sharing floor space with other participants.</p>

            <h3>Packing List</h3>
            <p>Things you&rsquo;ll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student ID:</strong> You&rsquo;ll need this to check in to the event.</li>
                <li><strong>Government-issued ID:</strong> If you want to borrow any hardware from our lab, you&rsquo;ll need to have a government-issued ID (like a driver&rsquo;s license) in addition to your student ID.</li>
                <li><strong>Laptop:</strong> Desktops aren&rsquo;t great travel companions.</li>
                <li><strong>Chargers (laptop, phone, etc.):</strong> Make sure to remember chargers for everything you&rsquo;re bringing.</li>
                <li><strong>Headphones:</strong> With so many hackers in one building, it can get a bit loud, so bring headphones if you want to get some quiet time.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleeping bag, air mattress, and/or pillow:</strong> If you&rsquo;re staying with a Princeton student host, you&rsquo;ll need to bring something to sleep on.</li>
                <li><strong>Towel and toiletries:</strong> You&rsquo;ll definitely want to shower over the weekend.</li>
                <li><strong>Layers for 30-60 degree weather:</strong> New Jersey has wild temperature swings, so bring a warm coat and clothes suitable for a wide range of conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusable water bottle:</strong> If you have one, bring it and help cut down on waste.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Things you won&rsquo;t need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Money for food:</strong> We&rsquo;ll be providing all the meals and snacks this weekend, so it&rsquo;s not necessary to bring money specifically for food. (The venue is close to lots of restaurants, though, so do bring some if you want to explore!)</li>
                <li><strong>Large suitcase:</strong> There&rsquo;s limited space for bags, so pack light. A duffel bag is a good idea.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>Here&rsquo;s a few miscellaneous things we&rsquo;ve received questions about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All meals and snacks are provided, so you don&rsquo;t have to bring any money for food.</li>
