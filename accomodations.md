# Overnight Accomodations

Unlike what you might be used to at other hackathons, Princeton does not permit 
sleeping overnight in the venue due to fire code restrictions. Instead of 
sleeping at the venue, you have three options:

1.  Arrange to stay with a friend overnight
2.  Arrange to stay at a local hotel. We do not have discount packages, but some nearby affordable hotels include the [Red Roof Inn](https://www.redroof.com/property/nj/lawrenceville/RRI111) and [DoubleTree by Hilton](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-jersey/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-princeton-PCTDTDT/index.html)
3.  Request that we match you with a Princeton student host

For the 3rd option: We can match you with a Princeton student host by request to 
stay with overnight. You’ll need to bring your own sleeping bag or 
air mattress, since you’ll likely be sharing floor space with other 
participants. Sign up for a host at [https://localhost.hackprinceton.com/](https://localhost.hackprinceton.com/).
