## Princeton @ HackPrinceton

Hey there, Princeton! Get ready for one of the most exciting weekends of the
year! From November 10-12, 600 brilliant students from close to 100 schools from
around the world will gather at Friend Center for 36 incredible hours of
learning, designing, and creating.

Whether you’re an experienced hacker or you’ve never taken COS 126, there are
many ways you can be involved. Check out all of them below, and if you have any
questions, email us at [team@hackprinceton.com](mailto:team@hackprinceton.com).

### Build

Turn your software and hardware ideas into reality alongside fellow students and
mentors from top tech companies. Whether or not you have an idea or a team,
we'll give you food and caffeine, laser tag and other mini events, swag and
prizes, and more. Come one, come all!

Register today at [my.hackprinceton.com](http://my.hackprinceton.com/).

### Host

Hundreds of amazing student hackers are coming to campus. Even if you aren’t
participating as a hacker, help us host students overnight for the weekend and
receive a $10 Amazon gift card per hosted hacker!

Sign up at [hackprinceton.com/host](/host).

### Mentor

Are you a hackathon veteran looking to share your wisdom? Or a Lab TA looking to
help with projects that aren't N-body or KD trees? This is your chance to help
others bring their crazy ideas to life.

If you have a particular skill you would like to teach others, we’d love to have
you hold a workshop. Some examples of student-led workshops in the past are
Android App Development, Intro UI Design, and Intro to HTML and CSS. Visit
[hackprinceton.com/workshop](/workshop) if you are interested in teaching a 25
minute or 50 minute workshop.

If you’d like to help hackers Lab TA - style and work with them on a variety of
different projects, sign up to become a mentor by visiting
[hackprinceton.com/mentor](/mentor).
