His background is in mechanical engineering from the aerospace, automotive, medical, and consumer products industries. His goal is to extend the blockchain into the internet of things with open P2P physical networks for P2P autonomous delivery, securing personal and enterprise embedded devices, and delay and disruption tolerant mesh networking for terrestrial and space applications. Ark is a lean platform of bridged, nested blockchains ideal for these applications.
