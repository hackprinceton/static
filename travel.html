            <h3 id="charter-buses">Charter Buses</h3>

            <p>We will be sending charter buses out to help accommodate travel to and from certain schools. Since demand is high, spots on these buses will be available on a first-come-first-served basis for students at or traveling from near those schools. Once at HackPrinceton, we will reimburse the cost of your ticket at our travel booth. After you purchase your ticket, the bus captain will reach out to you via email with further details within a couple of weeks.</p>

             <p>In order to guarantee a spot, you will need to purchase a (fully-reimbursable) ticket. The links will be sent out by email at a later date; spots will be claimed on a first-come-first-serve basis.</p>

            
            <h3 id="bus-faqs">Bus FAQs</h3>

            <p><strong>How will the deposit be refunded?</strong><br />We will refund participants on-site through our subsidy process. More details on how this works are in the subsidies section of this page.</p>

            <p><strong>What if I reserve a ticket but can’t come?</strong><br />You can transfer the ticket to any other accepted HackPrinceton participant. In order to receive a reimbursement for the ticket, you will be responsible for finding another participant. You can coordinate with your bus captain to facilitate the swapping.</p>

            <p><strong>I’m on the waitlist but the confirmation deadline passed, can I still confirm after the deadline if a spot opens up?</strong><br />Yes, we will extend the confirmation deadline for anyone who accepts a spot off the bus waitlist.</p>

            <p><strong>Can I reserve a ticket for someone else?</strong><br />Sure, but list the emails of your entire team when you reserve the tickets.</p>



            <h3 id="travel-subsidies">Travel Subsidies</h3>

            <p>If you applied for a travel reimbursement in your application, you may be eligible for a travel subsidy to help offset the cost of travel. The amount you receive is based on the region you are traveling from and is displayed on your dashboard.</p>

            <p>Our travel booth is open Saturday, November 11 from 2pm - 4pm and 7:30pm - 9:30pm at the front desk in the Friend Center. You must come to the booth to receive your travel or bus subsidy.</p>

            <p>Whether you have your return receipts yet or not, you still must come to the booth to receive your subsidy. If you do not come to the booth during this time, you will not be eligible for the reimbursement. We will provide instructions for submitting any return receipts at the booth. To save time, please bring some form of ID (unless you used it to borrow hardware).</p>

            <p>If you carpooled here or purchased multiple tickets on one receipt, please come as a group to help us combine your subsidies.</p>

            <p>In order to be eligible for the subsidy, you must be an accepted attendee and have checked in at registration. All expenses must have an accompanying itemized receipt. Subsidies may only be applied to transportation or gas costs, and may not be applied to travel upgrades (e.g. premium class, priority boarding), change fees, food, or other incidental expenses. We reserve the right to deny reimbursement.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> the amount you are eligible to receive is the amount displayed on your dashboard. If you were assigned to a charter bus, we will reimburse the deposit if you took the bus. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide reimbursement if you were assigned to a bus but took alternative travel.</p>

            <p>Travel subsidies are available on a limited basis, and thus we are unable to make adjustments except in extenuating circumstances.</p>

            <p>Please park in the North Garage (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/grzxysUX2jG2">map</a>), located near Friend Center at the northeast corner of campus. If the garage is full, you may also park in the Ivy Lane parking lots or Lot 21. Parking in any of these lots is free and you will not need to display a parking permit or overnight permit.

            <h3 id="arriving-by-plane">Arriving by Plane</h3>

            <p>If you’re flying to HackPrinceton, we recommend arriving at one of these airports: Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) or Philadelphia International Airport (PHL).</p>

            <p>Both airports are connected by train to Princeton, with EWR being the closer of the two.</p>

            <h3 id="arriving-by-train">Arriving by Train</h3>

            <p>The Princeton campus is serviced by an offshoot of the NJTransit Northeast Corridor train line. A train station (called the “Dinky”) is located at the southwest corner of campus. The train from this station travels between two stops, Princeton Station and Princeton Junction - the first is the one on campus, and the second is on the main Northeast Corridor route. You’ll need to transfer from the main route onto the second train to reach campus.</p>

            <p>Note that there are two stations with “Princeton” in their name: Princeton Station and Princeton Junction. Princeton Station is your final destination, and you must transfer there from Princeton Junction. You can buy a single train ticket all the way to Princeton Station and keep it for the transfer.</p>

            <p><strong>Train from New York City:</strong> From Penn Station, take the NJTransit Northeast Corridor (NOT Northeast Regional) train to Princeton Station, boarding in the Trenton-bound direction. At Princeton Junction, transfer to the “Dinky” train to continue to Princeton Station. Exact train times can be looked up on the NJTransit site or on Google Maps.</p>

            <p><strong>Train from Newark Airport (EWR):</strong> Once you leave the secure area, follow signs for the AirTrain, the inter-terminal monorail. Board the AirTrain for the RailLink station. Upon arrival, head up the stairs to the left and cross the bridge to the train station. From the blue-and-orange machines, purchase a ticket on the NJTransit Northeast Corridor (NOT Northeast Regional) train to Princeton Station. Then head to Track 5 to board the train towards Trenton. At Princeton Junction, transfer to the “Dinky” train to continue to Princeton Station. Exact train times can be looked up on the NJTransit site or on Google Maps.</p>

            <p><strong>Train from Philadelphia (including PHL):</strong> Take the train from the to 30th Street Station (the main station in Philly). Transfer here to the eastbound SEPTA train towards Trenton. At Trenton, transfer to the Newark/New York City-bound NJTransit Northeast Corridor (NOT Northeast Regional) train to Princeton Station. At Princeton Junction, transfer to the “Dinky” train to continue to Princeton Station. Exact train times can be looked up on the NJTransit site or on Google Maps.</p>
