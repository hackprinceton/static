You should plan on arriving around 5-6pm on Friday, November 10th and leaving
around 3pm on Sunday, November 12th.

## Charter Buses

We will be sending charter buses out to help accommodate travel to and from
certain schools. Since demand is high, spots on these buses will be available
on a first-come-first-served basis for students at or traveling from near
those schools. Once at HackPrinceton, we will reimburse the cost of your
ticket at our travel booth. After you purchase your ticket, the bus captain
will reach out to you via email with further details within a couple of weeks.

## Routes and Schedules

The schedule below is tentative and subject to change. Exact pickup locations

ticket through the relevant Eventbrite link below. The links will open at
exactly 3 PM on Wednesday October 18, 2017. Spots are available on a first-
come-first-serve basis.

## Bus FAQs

**How will the deposit be refunded?**   We will refund participants on-site
through our subsidy process. More details on how this works are in the
subsidies section of this page.

**What if I purchase a ticket but can’t come?**   Please cancel your ticket
order on the Eventbrite link immediately so that someone on the waitlist will
be notified and have time to claim their spot on the bus. The deadline to
cancel and request a refund through Eventbrite is Thursday, November 9, at
5:00PM EST. If you cancel after this time, or if you purchase a ticket and do
not come to the hackathon, we are not able to provide a refund. Note that we
are not able to provide any reimbursement for travel to the bus pickup
location.

**Can I purchase a ticket if I'm not assigned to a bus route?**  
Yes, but we discourage you from doing so because bus space is limited.

**I’m on the waitlist but the confirmation deadline passed, can I still confirm after the deadline if a spot opens up?**  
Yes, we will extend the confirmation deadline for anyone who accepts a spot off the bus waitlist.

**Can I reserve a ticket for someone else?**  
Yes, but list the emails of your entire team when you reserve the tickets.

## Travel Subsidies

If you applied for a travel reimbursement in your application, you may be
eligible for a travel subsidy to help offset the cost of travel. The amount
you receive is based on the region you are traveling from and is displayed on
your dashboard.

Our travel booth is open Saturday, November 11 from 2pm - 4pm and 7:30pm -
9:30pm at the front desk in the Friend Center. You must come to the booth to
receive your travel or bus subsidy.

Whether you have your return receipts yet or not, you still must come to the
booth to receive your subsidy. If you do not come to the booth during this
time, you will not be eligible for the reimbursement. We will provide
instructions for submitting any return receipts at the booth. To save time,
please bring some form of ID (unless you used it to borrow hardware).

If you carpooled here or purchased multiple tickets on one receipt, please
come as a group to help us combine your subsidies.

In order to be eligible for the subsidy, you must be an accepted attendee and
have checked in at registration. All expenses must have an accompanying
itemized receipt. Subsidies may only be applied to transportation or gas
costs, and may not be applied to travel upgrades (e.g. premium class, priority
boarding), change fees, food, or other incidental expenses. We reserve the
right to deny reimbursement.

**Note:** the amount you are eligible to receive is the amount displayed on
your dashboard. If you were assigned to a charter bus, we will reimburse the
deposit if you took the bus. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide
reimbursement if you were assigned to a bus but took alternative travel.

Travel subsidies are available on a limited basis, and thus we are unable to
make adjustments except in extenuating circumstances.

## Arriving by Car

Please park in the North Garage ([map][north-garage]), located near Friend
Center at the northeast corner of campus. If the garage is full, you may also
park in the Ivy Lane ([map][ivy-lane]) parking lots or Lot 2 ([map][lot-2]).
Note that the permitted lots are different from last spring and fall. Parking
in any of these lots is free and you will not need to display a parking permit
or overnight permit. Lots 21, 4, 5, 25, and Western Way will **not** be open.

## Arriving by Plane

If you’re flying to HackPrinceton, we recommend arriving at one of these
airports: Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) or Philadelphia
International Airport (PHL).

Both airports are connected by train to Princeton, with EWR being the closer
of the two.

## Arriving by Train

The Princeton campus is serviced by an offshoot of the NJTransit Northeast
Corridor train line. A train station (called the “Dinky”) is located at the
southwest corner of campus. The train from this station travels between two
stops, Princeton Station and Princeton Junction - the first is the one on
campus, and the second is on the main Northeast Corridor route. You’ll need to
transfer from the main route onto the second train to reach campus.

Note that there are two stations with “Princeton” in their name: Princeton
Station and Princeton Junction. Princeton Station is your final destination,
and you must transfer there from Princeton Junction. You can buy a single
train ticket all the way to Princeton Station and keep it for the transfer.

**Train from New York City:** From Penn Station, take the NJTransit Northeast
Corridor (NOT Northeast Regional) train to Princeton Station, boarding in the
Trenton-bound direction. At Princeton Junction, transfer to the “Dinky” train
to continue to Princeton Station. Exact train times can be looked up on the
NJTransit site or on Google Maps.

**Train from Newark Airport (EWR):**  Once you leave the secure area, follow
signs for the AirTrain, the inter-terminal monorail. Board the AirTrain for
the RailLink station. Upon arrival, head up the stairs to the left and cross
the bridge to the train station. From the blue-and-orange machines, purchase a
ticket on the NJTransit Northeast Corridor (NOT Northeast Regional) train to
Princeton Station. Then head to Track 5 to board the train towards Trenton. At
Princeton Junction, transfer to the “Dinky” train to continue to Princeton
Station. Exact train times can be looked up on the NJTransit site or on Google
Maps.

**Train from Philadelphia (including PHL):**  Take the train from the to 30th
Street Station (the main station in Philly). Transfer here to the eastbound
SEPTA train towards Trenton. At Trenton, transfer to the Newark/New York City-
bound NJTransit Northeast Corridor (NOT Northeast Regional) train to Princeton
Station. At Princeton Junction, transfer to the “Dinky” train to continue to
Princeton Station. Exact train times can be looked up on the NJTransit site or
on Google Maps.
